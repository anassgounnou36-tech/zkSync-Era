# zkSync Era Flashloan Arbitrage Bot Specification

## Overview
Production-grade arbitrage bot for zkSync Era with flashloans, upgradable contracts, role-based access control, off-chain orchestration, analytics, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **FlashloanRouterUpgradeable**: UUPS upgradable contract for managing flashloans
  - Generic `executeFlashloan(token, amount, data)` interface
  - Integration with zkSync Era DeFi protocols
  - SafeERC20 for token operations
  
- **ArbitrageExecutorUpgradeable**: UUPS upgradable contract for executing arbitrage
  - Token/pool whitelisting
  - Slippage protection
  - Multi-hop swap support
  - Emergency pause functionality

### 2. Access Control Roles
- **Admin**: Full contract control, can grant/revoke roles
- **Pauser**: Can pause/unpause contract operations
- **Executor**: Can execute arbitrage transactions
- **Strategist**: Can update strategy parameters
- **Withdrawer**: Can withdraw funds from contracts

### 3. Off-Chain Orchestration
- **Mempool Monitor**: Watches pending transactions for arbitrage opportunities
- **Price/Route Builder**: Calculates optimal arbitrage routes
- **Simulator**: Dry-run simulations before execution
- **Transaction Submitter**: Executes profitable trades
- **Alert System**: Telegram notifications for events

### 4. Analytics
- SQLite database for trade tracking
- PnL reporting
- Performance metrics

### 5. Security Features
- Upgradable contracts with UUPS pattern
- Role-based access control
- Reentrancy guards
- Slippage protection
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Static analysis with Slither

### 6. Deployment & Operations
- Hardhat zkSync configuration
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Stack
- Solidity ^0.8.20 with OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts
- TypeScript for off-chain components
- Hardhat with zkSync plugins
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint + Solhint for code quality
- Fastify for HTTP API
- Telegraf for Telegram integration
- Better-sqlite3 for analytics

## Development Workflow
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Lint: `npm run lint`
4. Test: `npm run test`
5. Deploy: `npm run deploy`
6. Monitor: `npm run monitor`

## Configuration
All sensitive data in .env file:
- Private keys
- RPC endpoints
- Telegram credentials
- Contract addresses
- Strategy parameters

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical contract functions
- Integration tests for arbitrage flows
- Mock contracts for local testing
- Testnet deployment before mainnet

## Safety Guidelines
- Start with small amounts on testnet
- Verify all contract interactions
- Monitor gas prices
- Set conservative slippage limits
- Use multi-sig for admin operations
- Regular security audits
